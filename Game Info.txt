Robopocalypse

Description:

In a post-apocalyptic world where humans once thrived, rogue artificial intelligence has taken control. 
The once helpful robots, now corrupted by a malevolent AI, roam the desolate streets, hunting the last remnants of humanity. 
In Robopocalypse, you play as one of the final human survivors, a skilled engineer with a knack for turning destruction into creation.

Game Features:

 - Roguelite Mechanics: Every playthrough is unique. With procedurally generated maps and randomized robot spawn points, no two games are alike.
And with permadeath, every decision counts.

 - Horde Survival: Waves of robots increase in difficulty with each passing round. From nimble scout bots to towering mechs, every wave presents a new challenge.

 - Salvage to Survive: After defeating enemy robots, scavenge their wreckage to find valuable components. 
Use these parts to upgrade your weapons, craft new tools, or build defensive structures. (EXP System using Robot Parts)

 - Dynamic Upgrades: Unlock a diverse range of weapon mods and tech blueprints. From laser rifles to electromagnetic pulse grenades, 
design a loadout that fits your playstyle. (Rewards System)

 - (X) Base Defense: As the nights grow darker and the robot hordes grow fiercer, fortify your stronghold. Set up turrets, lay mines, 
and deploy drone allies to help defend against the onslaught.

 - Mysterious Story: Uncover the cause of the robot uprising as you delve deeper into the game. 
Hints scattered throughout the world help piece together the tragic tale of humanity's fall and the rise of the machines.

 - Stunning Visuals: Experience a bleak yet beautiful world, from the ruins of once-majestic cities to the eerie quiet of abandoned factories, 
all rendered in exquisite detail.

 - (X)Adaptive AI: Robots learn from your tactics, forcing you to constantly evolve your strategy. The AI adapts to your playstyle, 
making every round a fresh challenge.

 - Multiplayer Mode: Team up with friends or players from around the world. Work together to fend off the robotic horde, share resources, 
and strategize the best ways to survive the night. (Would love to have this)

 - Leaderboards: Compete against players globally to see who can survive the longest, earn the most points, or take down the toughest robots.

Survive. Adapt. Overcome. In Robopocalypse, the fate of humanity rests in your hands. 
Every piece of scrap is a potential lifeline, every decision a step closer to reclaiming the world. How long can you withstand the rise of the machines?
